        <p>The Gold Coast, located in the eastern state of Queensland, has been made famous by its gold, sandy beaches and high-rise dominated skyline. A city of vast diversity, the Gold Coast offers the perfect destination for delegates who are looking to combine an association event with the opportunity to enjoy an unforgettable Australian experience. </p>
        <p>The Australian meetings industry has the contacts and expertise to tailor a convention to your association’s needs with access to logistic specialists, a range of talented speakers including world leaders, and special event experts to give your event the final touches. </p>
        <p>Here we profile an example of a recent association workshop held on the Gold Coast to tell you a little more about why delegates will jump at the chance to attend an event in the picturesque city of the Gold Coast. </p>
        <p><strong>THE EVENT: The 10th IAPR International Workshop on Document Analysis Systems – DAS 2012 <br />
        </strong>Leading computer researchers and academics from 32 countries around the world arrived on the Gold Coast in March 2012 for the 10th IAPR International Workshop on Document Analysis Systems (DAS 2012).</p>
        <p>Over 130 delegates attended the workshop to discuss the advance of the science that drives pattern recognition technology – sharing exciting insights into the future on how technology could evolve.</p>
        <p>Associate Professor Michael Blumenstein, Chair of the Workshop and Dean of Griffith University’s Research, Science, Environment, Engineering and Technology Group, said he was proud to have brought some of the top minds in the field to Australia.  </p>
        <p>“We had a magnificent line up of academic researchers and industry experts from around the world and we are delighted with the feedback we received from the attendees, with many having said it was the most successful workshop to date,” said Associate Professor Blumenstein. </p>
        <p>“Guests absolutely loved the beach and our international guests got a wonderful taste of Australia. We treated delegates to a trip to ‘The Outback Spectacular’ – a very unique and exciting evening dinner show filled with outback music, drama and action,” he added.  <br />
        The attractions of the Gold Coast played a key factor in the bid for DAS 2012. As Australia’s undisputed home of entertainment, the city provides the perfect backdrop for an association event with its subtropical climate, famous surfing beaches, numerous attractions – including the biggest collection of theme parks in the Southern Hemisphere – restaurants, bars, and surrounding rainforest hinterland.<br />
        <strong><br />
        While visiting the Gold Coast … </strong></p>
        <p>If delegates would like to escape the hustle and bustle of the ‘golden city’ for the day, Tamborine Mountain is only 30 kilometres away. With breathtaking scenery, abundant wildlife and clean mountain air, Tamborine Mountain can be described as the ‘green behind the gold’. For a unique experience, visitors can also experience the Tamborine Rainforest Skywalk – an elevated walkway, high above the ground in the rainforest canopy which descends gradually to the densely vegetated rainforest floor.  </p>
        <p>If delegates are looking for an spectacular place to stay, soaring above the iconic Surfers Paradise beach, the Hilton is the Gold Coast’s newest accommodation having recently undergone an A$700 million dollar transformation. The hotel offers guest rooms with floor-to-ceiling windows, a gourmet marketplace, European delicatessen, day spa, sauna and elegant event spaces offering five-star sophistication for association events.  </p>
