Listen for the tenor-like song of the wompoo fruit-dove, the haunting call of the spotted catbird and the Kermit croak of the large-tailed nightjar. From September, you can spot glamorous brown-backed honeyeaters and Australia’s kingfishers. The cuckoos arrive in November with the thunderstorms, adding their raucous call to the morning din."}'}}
