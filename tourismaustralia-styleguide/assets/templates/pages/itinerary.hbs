Wind close to Jenolan Road, past trees of grey gum, stringybark and the blackwood after which the Black Range was probably named. Your final descent is to the labyrinth-like Jenolan Caves - one of the largest underground cave systems in the world.</p>
        <p>Tour the caves and marvel at the delicate crystalline decorations of Orient Cave. Step over underground rivers and past prehistoric formations. Get goosebumps on a ghost tour or enjoy a cave concert with natural acoustics and fairytale ambience. After two nights sleeping rough, you can reward yourself with a night in a grand hotel or comfortable bed and breakfast.</p>"
